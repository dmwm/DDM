##H Usage: OracleSyns.sh MASTER MASTER/MPASS@DB ACCOUNT/APASS@DB
##H
##H MASTER should be the master account name (cms_transfermgmt),
##H and MPASS it's password. ACCOUNT/APASS should be similar
##H pair for the account into which synonyms should be created
##H (cms_transfermgmt_reader/_writer). Both arguments will be
##H passed to "sqlplus" as such.

##H tables as appropriate. All previous synonyms are removed
##H and fresh ones are created from master table list.
